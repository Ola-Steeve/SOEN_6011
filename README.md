# Arccos Function ‚Äì SOEN 6011 Project (Design Document 1)

This repository implements **Function 1: arccos(x)** for SOEN 6011 ‚Äî Software Engineering Processes. The goal is to develop a mathematically sound, reliable, and user-friendly function to compute the inverse cosine of a number `x` ‚àà \[‚Äì1, 1], with a graphical user interface and full error handling, following software engineering best practices.

## üíª Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ola-Steeve/SOEN_6011.git
cd SOEN_6011
```

### 2. Build the project with Maven

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 3. Run the application

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="ArccosConsole"
```

Or run the compiled jar directly:

```bash
java -cp target/ArccosConsole-1.1.0.jar ArccosConsole
```
